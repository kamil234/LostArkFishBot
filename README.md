# LostArkFishBot
Basic lost ark fish bot, created in Python

How to use:

1. Make sure you have python and all the dependencies installed (autopygui and all of it's dependencies)
2. Download the files and extract
3. Open up "PressButton.py" and set the key you use to cast and reel (default: 'e')
5. Go to fishing spot, start bot, and mouseover the water so you can cast 
6. Enjoy.

Further updates are unlikely as I no longer play LostArk.
